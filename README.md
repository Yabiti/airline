# 🛫 Domestic Flights in Ethiopia 🇪🇹

Hello there! I'm **Yabetse Yohannes**, a passionate developer from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. This project is all about domestic flights in Ethiopia. I've used Django, HTML, CSS, Python, and SQL to bring this project to life.

## 🎨 Frontend

The frontend of this project was built using **HTML** and **CSS** on Django. I worked on the project alone, handling both the frontend and backend.

## ⚙️ Backend

The backend includes **Python** and **MySQL**, providing a robust and efficient system for managing data.

Working alone on this project has been a great learning experience. It helped me improve a lot in frontend development. I found solutions all by myself, which helped me learn many things during this project.

My first challenge was creating the ideas and figuring out how to implement them. It really takes time to do this kind of project, but I learned a lot in the process.

## 🏁 Conclusion
